> ### [Spring Boot] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Spring Boot]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Spring Boot]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

- Spring Boot(Java)
  - JPA
  - Security
- H2
- Vue3
    - Vite
    - vuerouter
    - vuex
- localStorage

# Getting started

## Run Local
```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

# FrontEnd

**I don't know much about the front end. I wanted to create a visible application, so I adopted and implemented that framework.**

But my codes are simple codes that even beginners can easily see.
